FullSail University Final iOS Project

GeoScavenge is a virtual scavenger hunt with a twist.  We don't tell you where you're going or a direction, just how far you are away.  Be careful though, many of our puzzles include lockouts once you've used all your guesses.  All of our puzzles are community created so our database is constantly evolving.  You can even create new puzzles yourself, right inside the app!
